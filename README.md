# Excel-Project
This is my Excel project, which contains a sales dashboard for a fictional company. This dashboard present a story based on transactional historical data from 2019 to 2021. 
There was 10,889 raws or transactions. The data was stored in two workbooks and and referenced using lookup functions in a single worksheet to create this analysis. 
The dashboard was created based on a Youtube tutorial video.
